abstract = {Mass movements varying in type and size, some of which are periodically reactivated, affect the urban area of Avigliano. The disturbed and remoulded masses consist of sandy-silty or silty-clayey plastic material interbedded with stone fragments and conglomerate blocks. Five landslides that were markedly liable to rainfall-associated instability phenomena were selected. The relationships between landslides and rainfall were investigated using a hydrological and statistical model based on long-term series of daily rainfall data. The model was used to determine the return period of cumulative daily rainfall over 1-180 days. The resulting hydrological and statistical findings are discussed with the aim of identifying the rainfall duration most critical to landslides. The concept of a precipitation threshold was generalized by defining some probability classes of cumulative rainfall. These classes indicate the thresholds beyond which reactivation is likely to occur. The probability classes are defined according to the return period of the cumulative rainfall concomitant with landslide reactivation.},

abstract = {Statistical models that exploit the correlation between landslide occurrence and geomorphic properties are often used to map the spatial occurrence of shallow landslides triggered by heavy rainfalls. In many landslide susceptibility studies, the true predictive power of the statistical model remains unknown because the predictions are not validated with independent data from other events or areas. This study validates statistical susceptibility predictions with independent test data. The spatial incidence of landslides, triggered by an extreme rainfall in a study area, was modeled by logistic regression. The fitted model was then used to generate susceptibility maps for another three study areas, for which event-based landslide inventories were also available. All the study areas lie in the northern foothills of the Swiss Alps. The landslides had been triggered by heavy rainfall either in 2002 or 2005. The validation was designed such that the first validation study area shared the geomorphology and the second the triggering rainfall event with the calibration study area. For the third validation study area, both geomorphology and rainfall were different. All explanatory variables were extracted for the logistic regression analysis from high-resolution digital elevation and surface models (2.5. m grid). The model fitted to the calibration data comprised four explanatory variables: (i) slope angle (effect of gravitational driving forces), (ii) vegetation type (grassland and forest; root reinforcement), (iii) planform curvature (convergent water flow paths), and (iv) contributing area (potential supply of water). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to quantify the predictive performance of the logistic regression model. The AUC values were computed for the susceptibility maps of the three validation study areas (validation AUC), the fitted susceptibility map of the calibration study area (apparent AUC: 0.80) and another susceptibility map obtained for the calibration study area by 20-fold cross-validation (cross-validation AUC: 0.74). The AUC values of the first and second validation study areas (0.72 and 0.69, respectively) and the cross-validation AUC matched fairly well, and all AUC values were distinctly smaller than the apparent AUC. Based on the apparent AUC one would have clearly overrated the predictive performance for the first two validation areas. Rather surprisingly, the AUC value of the third validation study area (0.82) was larger than the apparent AUC. A large part of the third validation study area consists of gentle slopes, and the regression model correctly predicted that no landslides occur in the flat parts. This increased the predictive performance of the model considerably. The predicted susceptibility maps were further validated by summing the predicted susceptibilities for the entire validation areas and by comparing the sums with the observed number of landslides. The sums exceeded the observed counts for all the validation areas. Hence, the logistic regression model generally over-estimated the risk of landslide occurrence. Obviously, a predictive model that is based on static geomorphic properties alone cannot take a full account of the complex and time dependent processes in the subsurface. However, such a model is still capable of distinguishing zones highly or less prone to shallow landslides. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Assessing the causes of stream impairments is challenging without a clear understanding of the spatiotemporal interactions among human infrastructure networks and hydrologic systems. Landscape change is often characterized using simplistic metrics that lump changes into generalized categories, such as impervious cover. We examined the evolution of human infrastructure in Panther Hollow, a small watershed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to characterize the impacts of long-term ({\~{}}100 years) landscape change on stream flow. Results show that impervious cover in the catchment grew from 3 {\%} in 1900 to 27 {\%} in 2010. Growth was non-linear, with 60 {\%} of the development occurring between 1904 and 1930. We then compared two models that predict changes in annual water yield, one model based on watershed impervious cover and one based on human infrastructure arrangement. The model based solely on impervious cover predicts excessive amounts of surface runoff relative to the infrastructure model and monitored yield. This discrepancy occurs because the impervious model does not account for the diversion of 50 {\%} of the watershed drainage through the combined sewer system to an adjacent basin. In the Panther Hollow watershed, hydrology is dominated by a reduction in water yield, contrasting typical hydrologic changes associated with urbanization. Our analysis reveals the value of quantifying additional landscape metrics, such as infrastructure pattern and connectivity, which provide a more complete understanding of how human development alters natural hydrology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Several times in the past catastrophic flooding events have taken place in these areas. This paper concerns the geologic and geomorphologic features, human intervention and its impact, along with their interaction. The locations with the highest vulnerability to flooding were registered. GIS processing served to present the results of this investigation. The relief of the region, the geologic and geomorphologic conditions, the stream flow features, the drying up of wetlands and lagoons, the elimination of vegetation cover, the urbanization of streams and the deficient draining networks, are the main causes of flooding generation in the study area. Some major suggestions dealing effectively with the problem are given.},

abstract = {A large number of hillslope failures have been observed within a section of the Transverse Ranges north of the city of Los Angeles. The abundance and seemingly random distribution of these landslides poses a threat to infrastructure and utility lines vital to the needs of the Los Angeles area. The types of hillslope failures found in the area include shallow surface landslides and deep-seated failures. The spatial factors controlling the distribution of landslide location and types in this area remains poorly understood. In this study, we attempt to use topographic information derived from high resolution digital elevation models in order to identify key spatial relationships that can be used to explain and predict the distribution of landslide locations within the study area. Landslides were identified and mapped in a GIS using a combination of highresolution digital elevation models and low altitude aerial photography. The high resolution DEM was then used to derive topographic measurements that include slope, aspect, curvature, landslide area, and hydrologic area for each landslide. Spatial correlations between slide position and possible stability control factors are identified. Results indicate that shallow landslides are more likely to be influenced by topographic variables than deep-seated landslides. In addition, the speed at which these landslides were mapped and key topographic statistics derived suggests that the use of LiDAR is an efficient and effective tool for such regional-scale landslide investigations.

abstract = {Flash floods are considered to be one of the worst weather-related natural disasters. They are dangerous because they are sudden and are highly unpredictable following brief spells of heavy rain. Several qualitative methods exist in the literature for the estimations of the risk level of flash flood hazard within a watershed. This paper presents the utilization of remote sensing data such as enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), coupled with geological, geomorphological, and field data in a GIS environment for the estimation of the flash flood risk along the Feiran–Katherine road, southern Sinai, Egypt. This road is a vital corridor for the tourists visiting here for religious purposes (St. Katherine monastery) and is subjected to frequent flash floods, causing heavy damage to man-made features. In this paper, morphometric analyses have been used to estimate the flash flood risk levels of sub-watersheds within the Wadi Feiran basin. First, drainage characteristics are captured by a set of parameters relevant to the flash flood risk. Further, comparison between the effectiveness of the sub-basins has been performed in order to understand the active ones. A detailed geomorphological map for the most hazardous sub-basins is presented. In addition, a map identifying sensitive sections is constructed for the Feiran–Katherine road. Finally, the most influenced factors for both flash flood hazard and critical sensitive zones have been discussed. The results of this study can initiate appropriate measures to mitigate the probable hazards in the area.},

abstract = {Topography acts as a template for numerous landscape processes that include hydrologic, ecologic, and biologic phenomena. These processes not only interact with each other but also contribute to shaping the landscape as they influence geomorphic processes. We have investigated the effects of vegetation on thresholds for channel initiation and landform evolution using both analytical and numerical approaches. Vegetation is assumed to form a uniform ground cover. Runoff erosion is modeled based on a power function of excess shear stress, in which shear stress efficiency is inversely proportional to vegetation cover. This approach is validated using data. Plant effect on slope stability is represented by additional cohesion provided by plant roots. Vegetation cover is assumed to reduce sediment transport rates due to physical creep processes (rainsplash, dry ravel, and expansion and contraction of sediments) according to a negative exponential relationship. Vegetation grows as a function of both available cover and unoccupied space by plants and is killed by geomorphic disturbances (runoff erosion and landsliding) and wildfires. Analytical results suggest that in an equilibrium basin with a fixed vegetation cover, plants may cause a transition in the dominant erosion process at the channel head. A runoff erosion–dominated landscape, under none or poor vegetation cover, may become landslide dominated under a denser vegetation cover. The sign of the predicted relationship between drainage density and vegetation cover depends on the relative influence of vegetation on different erosion phenomena. With model parameter values representative of the Oregon Coast Range (OCR), numerical experiments conducted using the Channel Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model confirm the findings based on the analytical theory. A highly dissected fluvial landscape emerges when surface is assumed bare. When vegetation cover is modeled, landscape relief increases, resulting in hollow erosion dominated by landsliding. Interestingly, our simulations underscore the importance of vegetation disturbances by geomorphic events and wildfires on the landscape structure. Simulated landscapes resemble real-world catchments in the OCR when such disturbances are considered.},

abstract = {The Guil River Valley (Queyras, Southern French Alps) is prone to catastrophic floods, as the long historical archives and Holocene sedimentary records demonstrate. In June 2000, the upper part of this valley was affected by a "30-year" recurrence interval (R.I.) flood. Although of lower magnitude and somewhat different nature from that of 1957 ({\textgreater}100-year R.I. flood), the 2000 event induced serious damage to infrastructure and buildings on the valley floor. Use of methods including high-resolution aerial photography, multi-date mapping, hydraulic calculations and field observations made possible the characterisation of the geomorphic impacts on the Guil River and its tributaries. The total rainfall (260 mm in four days) and maximum hourly intensity (17.3 mm h-1), aggravated by pre-existing saturated soils, explain the immediate response of the fluvial system and the subsequent destabilisation of slopes. Abundant water and sediment supply (landsliding, bank erosion), particularly from small catchment basins cut into slaty, schist bedrock, resulted in destructive pulses of debris flow and hyperconcentrated flows. The specific stream power of the Guil and its tributaries was greater than the critical stream power, thus explaining the abundant sediment transport. The Guil discharge was estimated as 180 m3 s-1 at Aiguilles, compared to the annual mean discharge of 6 m3 s-1 and a June mean discharge of 18 m3 s-1. The impacts on the Guil valley floor (flooding, aggradation, generalised bank erosion and changes in the river pattern) were widespread and locally influenced by variations in the floodplain slope and/or channel geometry. The stream partially reoccupied former channels abandoned or modified in their geometry by various structures built during the last four decades, as exemplified by the Aiguilles case study, where the worst damage took place. A comparative study of the geomorphic consequences of both the 1957 and 2000 floods shows that, despite their poor maintenance, the flood control structures built after the 1957 event were relatively efficient, in contrast to unprotected places. The comparison also demonstrates the role of land-use changes (conversion from traditional agro-pastoral life to a ski/hiking-based economy, construction of various structures) in reducing the Guil channel capacity and, more generally, in increasing the vulnerability of the human installations. The efficiency of the measures taken after the 2000 flood (narrowing and digging out of the channel) is also assessed. Final evaluation suggests that, in such high mountainous environments, there is a need to keep most of the 1957 flooded zone clear of buildings and other structures (aside from the existing villages and structures of particular economic interest), in order to enable the river to migrate freely and to adjust to exceptional hydro-geomorphic conditions without causing major damage. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.
