## Abstract

We examined the influence of various topographic parameters on damage to infrastructure in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Eight three-by-three block areas, selected to isolate variations in slope, drainage density, and drainage area, were chosen for field analyses. Investigators measured sidewalk cracks, tilted walls, and other common damaged features prevalent at all locations. Our statistical analyses suggest qualitative estimations of damage magnitude and structure age may be inconsistent between groups, which complicate an accurate interpretation of data. Additionally, we suggest that socioeconomic factors may control the distribution and severity of damaged infrastructure, as it is linked to older and less maintained infrastructure. Condition-desirability-utility (CDU) score, a qualitative metric provided for properties by Allegheny County, may be the best existing metric to capture these variations on a city-wide scale. Preliminary results suggest that slope and drainage density are positively related with damage and should be analyzed in further studies.
